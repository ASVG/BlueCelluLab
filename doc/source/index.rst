Introduction
============

BGLibpy is a Pythonic API and infrastructure leveraging Neurodamus to facilitate the
detailed study of small numbers of neurons in simulations defined by Neurodamus and
a BlueConfig. Use cases for which BGLibpy is well suited include: scripting
and statistics across single or pairs of cells, light-weight detailed
reporting on a few state variables post-simulation, development of synaptic
plasticity rules, dynamics validations of e.g. synaptic properties, automation
of in-silico whole-cell patching experiments.
