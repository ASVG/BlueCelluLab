The ballstick circuit
=====================

Two cells: "a1", "a2"

a1:

Excitatory cell which makes one synapse on a2 150 um from the soma
Synapse parameters: gsyn=1nS, udf=(0.5,650,10), dtc=2.0


a2:

Inhibitory cell which makes one synapse on a2 100 um from the soma
Synapse parameters: gsyn=1nS, udf=(0.5,650,10), dtc=10.0

See write_nrn_h5.py (which generates the nrn.h5) for more details.

ballstick circuit simulation
============================

BlueConfig

Overrides various synapse properties (e.g. for exc syns:tau_r_AMPA=0.001, NMDA_ratio=0.0, Use=1.0, see BlueConfig)

Replay spike from a1 @ 400ms 
(spike occurs at synapse of a2 @ 401ms due to synaptic delay of 1ms)

Replay spike from a2 @ 450ms 
(spike occurs at synapse of a1 @ 451ms due to synaptic delay of 1ms)
