The two_cell circuit
=====================

Two cells: "a1", "a2"

a1:

Excitatory L5 cell


a2:

Excitatory L6 cell



two_cell circuit simulation
============================

BlueConfig.empty.template:
BlueConfig with only header, no stimuli or replay

BlueConfig.noisestim.template:
BlueConfig with only noisy stimulus and hypamp

BlueConfig.replay.template:
BlueConfig with only spike replay

BlueConfig.minis.replay.template:
BlueConfig with only spike replay and minis enabled

BlueConfig.all.template
BlueConfig with all the above enabled

BlueConfig.all_mvr.template
BlueConfig with all the above enabled, and mvr tested


Creating the two_cell circuit and simulations in the test directory
===================================================================

Login to the cscs viz cluster
Change the working directory to the directory that contains the create_sims_twocell.py script
Look at the run.sh script for an example on how to run the creation process

In short:
Make sure bglibpy is in your python environment.
Make sure the ReportingLib is in your environment.
Change the neurodamus path in templates/run.sh.template so that it points to a compiled 'special'
Execute "./run.sh"
