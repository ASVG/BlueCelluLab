Introduction
============

BGLibpy is a Pythonic API and infrastructure leveraging BGlib to facilitate the 
detailed study of small numbers of neurons in simulations defined by BGLib &    
a BlueConfig. Use cases for which BGLibpy is well suited include: scripting     
and statistics across single or pairs of cells, light-weight detailed           
reporting on a few state variables post-simulation, development of synaptic     
plasticity rules, dynamics validations of e.g. synaptic properties, automation  
of in-silico whole-cell patching experiments.
