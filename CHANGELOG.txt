4.4.14:
- Remove python27 from the jenkins plan
4.4.13:
- introducing t_start, t_stop, t_step parameters for get_mainsim_voltage_trace.
4.4.11:
- Use h5py<3.0.0 since it's using different data types for strings now
4.4.6:
- Remove pyrsistent dependency since bluepy handles it
- Remove unused pandas dependency
- Tox to use download=true to get the recent pip that comes with a new dependency resolver
- removed the old bluepy-configfile-0.1.2.dev1 version dependency (bluepy already has bluepy-configfile>=0.1.11)
4.4.5:
- setting RNGSettings.mode will also set bglibpy.neuron.h.rngMode automatically
4.4.4:
- noisestim_count to be incremented whether or not it's applied to the gid
4.4.2:
- Added check to make sure targets used by _evaluate_connection_parameters exist.
4.4.1:
- Fixed synapse_detail error log when add_minis is False and synapse detail>0
4.4:
- Change behavior delayed connection blocks, weight is now a scaler instead of
absolute value

4.3.21:
- Force pyrsistent<0.17.1 version.

4.3.20:
- Fix printv in synapse.py

4.3.19:
- When get time trace from mainsim, only look at 1 gid to save memory

4.3.18:
- Removed all_targets_dict, since it uses too much memory in new circuits, replaced with direct bluepy call and lru_cache

4.3.17:
- Added explicit delete() method to ssim
- Test for leftover sections in NEURON during tests

4.3.16:
- Added a setting to ignore missing population id in projection blocks
- Added custom exceptions module

4.3.15:
- Added support for MorphologyType in BlueConfig

4.3.10:
- Use analytical solution for hill coefficient

4.3.9:
- Add support for a* targets in connection blocks

4.3.8:
- Vectorised usage of bluepy api for get_sonama_mecombo_emodels

4.3.4:
- Add node_properties_available to check if nodes.h5 can be used
- Add get_sonata_mecombo_emodels to extract nodes.h5 properties
- setup.py to use bluepy[sonata]>=0.14.12, needed for bluepysnap
- Add bglibpy/tests/examples/sim_sonata_node/ test directory

4.3:
- Add ability to read inh/exc minis from sonata nodes file
- Add use scaling based on hill coefficient / extracellular calcium concentration
- Add ability to read conductance ratio from sonata nodes file
- Rely on BluePy to read nrn.h5 version
- Execute nosetests in parallel
- Add OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 to test to avoid running out of resources
- Stop testing for deprecation warning when using .syns
- Use lru_cache to optimize bluepy query
- Add CHANGELOG
