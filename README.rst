Bluecellulab
=======

BlueCelluLab is designed to do simulation and experiment on a single cell or a group of cells. Use cases for which bluecellulab is well suited include: scripting and statistics across single or pairs of cells, light-weight detailed reporting on a few state variables post-simulation, development of synaptic plasticity rules, dynamics validations of e.g. synaptic properties, automation of in-silico whole-cell patching experiments, debugging both scientifically and computationally.
